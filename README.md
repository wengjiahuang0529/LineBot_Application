2. When you run python app.py, you will see the device name. IoTtalk's device needs to connect to this name.

3. You can run linebot_echo.py, but you need to change the token and secret to your own. You can apply for these at [Line Developers](https://developers.line.biz/en/).  
After executing, when you type in this Line channel, you'll see it echo back exactly what you typed.

4. NgrokÔºåit provides a service that helps developers share sites and apps running on their local machines or
servers.
   * Start a tunnel : ngrok http port
